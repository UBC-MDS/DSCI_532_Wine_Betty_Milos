## Wine Review Milestone 3

### Reflection on the usefulness of the feedback you received.


#### 1. Reflect on the usability of your app. How easy or hard was it for your peers to use your app? Did you expect them to use the app in they way they did?

The app even in that state was surprisingly robust and more or less intuitive to use when presented for feedback. The users had little trouble navigating the two sliders in order to narrow down the wine types they were looking for. We also noticed that they used the filters that were built into the table in order to fine filter their search according to parameters that are not related to price or wine rating.

#### 2. What feedback was the most/least valuable?

What we really appreciated was that the feedback acted like a quality control test of the app. A lot of little bugs we were not aware of were brought to our attention. For example, we set our upper limit for the price slider to $100 and did not realize that many wines over $100 were excluded. We also formatted the font size of our visualizations to make the labels more clear.

One reviewer suggested including a map to show the wine origin, but the other three reviewers suggested not to because the map would be more of a “cool” factor than an informative visual. Therefore, we decided to not implement the map as it does not provide more value to the usage scenario of our app and might actually confuse the users further.

We were recommended to add a country or wine variety selection widget for the distribution charts in replacement of the table, but two reviewers really liked the table. These two users preferred the search bars in the table for filtering the country and wine, rather than going through a long drop-down menu to select the country or wine variety. Therefore, we decided to keep the table with the search boxes.

#### 3. What did you learn from your experience being a "fly-on-the-wall". Was this useful? Why or why not?

The  "fly-on-the-wall" was very useful for identifying areas of the app that could make the app more easily navigable for new users and helped pinpoint problems that would not have been obvious to the creators. For example, we thought it was obvious that the search bars under each column indicated that you could filter results in each column further, but the users suggested to add a statement explicitly stating the functionality of the search boxes.


### Reflection on how your project has changed since Milestone 2, and why.

All in all, we improved our app by making it more user-friendly and easily navigable by including help text and notes throughout the app. Our objective stayed the same as the reviewers all agreed that the app was intuitive and easy to understand.
