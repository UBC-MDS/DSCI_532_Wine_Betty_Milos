## Wine Review Milestone 3

**Reflection on the usefulness of the feedback you received.**


### 1. Reflect on the usability of your app. How easy or hard was it for your peers to use your app? Did you expect them to use the app in they way they did?

The app even in that state was surprisingly robust and more or less intuitive to use when presented for feedback. The users we presented the app to had little trouble navigating the two sliders in order to narrow down the wine types they were looking for. We also noticed that they used the filters that were built into the table in order to fine filter their search according to parameters that are not related to price or wine rating.

### 2. What things did you hear that's similar across reviewers? Is there a theme here?

We heard many times that the app was easy to use and that adding extra widgets would not increase usability. The theme of less is more was quite evident. We had suggestions to add more ways to interact with the table that are explained in more detail below but the ideas were not generally well received. One theme in regards to feedback was that we needed to add a specific sentences to clear up potential misconceptions about the ratings (the minimum rating is 80 in the dataset) and a short sentence to explain up how the search bars can be used above the table.

### 3 What feedback was the most/least valuable?

What we really appreciated was that the feedback acted like a quality control test of the app. A lot of little bugs were brought up that we did not notice which we fixed. For example we set our upper limit for the price slider to 100$ not realising that any wines over 100$ were excluded. We also formatted some of the lettering to make easier to read.

What we also learned was that some of our extra features we were proposing(extra widgets, including a world map that would highlight the countries from which our filtered wines come from) were not very well received. This was a theme across the board except for one reviewer that liked the map but not the table. The majority of our reviewers liked the table and the deployed sliders and felt that the map would not add anything new. In fact they felt that the map while being a cool addition would reduce the usability of the app. 

### 4. What did you learn from your experience being a "fly-on-the-wall". Was this useful? Why or why not?

The  "fly-on-the-wall" was very useful for identifying areas of the app that could make the app more easily navigable for new users and pinpoint problems that would not have been obvious to the creators. For example, we thought it was obvious that the search bars under each column indicated that you could filter results in each column further, but the users suggested to add a statement explicitly stating the functionality of the search boxes.


**Reflection on how your project has changed since Milestone 2, and why.**

All in all, we improved our app by making it more user-friendly and easily navigable by including help text and notes throughout the app. Our objective stayed the same as the reviewers all agreed that the app was intuitive and easy to understand.
