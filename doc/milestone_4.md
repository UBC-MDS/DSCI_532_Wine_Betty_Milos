## Wine Review Milestone 4

Contributors: Milos Milic and Betty Zhou

1. What changes did you decide to implement given the time limit, and why do you think this is the best thing to focus on?

 We decided to implement a map on our wishlist to highlight the countries from which the filtered wines originated from. We were already satisfied with the outcome of our app as it was robust, free of bugs and intuitive to use. Therefore, we thought it was best to add the map as an extra feature to help the user visualize the filtered results and to complement the table we had already implemented.

2. If you were to make the app again from scratch (or some other app in general), what would you do differently?

We would still implement our app the way we did, but if given more time, we would have wanted to make our map more interactive. As we had implemented a map to complement the information shown in the table of our app, an interesting addition would be to implement a hover to show the specific wine regions and country counts using leaflet rather than just highlighting the map. This would be more informative as the hover would explicitly provide the geographic information about the filtered wines.

3. What were the greatest challenges you faced in creating the final product?

The greatest challenge for us was deciding on which features of the app we wanted to implement, given the time and knowledge constraints. Our ultimate goal was to implement a bug free app that had the functionality of filtering out the wines and display the data correctly. This meant focusing on tables, implementation of the sliders, and making sure the tabs work as needed. We also attempted to construct an interactive map using Leaflet, but given the time constraint, we were unable to construct a fully functional map using Leaflet. Therefore, we decided to deploy the map we constructed using ggplot as it was a good additional feature to our app.
