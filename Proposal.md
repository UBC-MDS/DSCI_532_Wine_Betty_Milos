# Wine Review Proposal
## 1. Overview

When costumers filter products based on specified preferences on the website of a large liquor supply chain, they often receive pages and pages of product recommendations. This can cause costumer frustration and discourage them from continuing their search for a product from the company.  To address this challenge and help large liquor supply chains maintain their customer base, we propose building a data visualization app that can be deployed by liquor supply chains for their costumers to visually explore and navigate a large inventory to receive wine recommendations in a less cluttered form. The app will show the count distribution of wines, which are the recommended wines based on the factors selected by the user. In addition, the app will provide a mapping of the wine recommendations on an interactive world map and show a summary, such as average price and count of the wines, for each country based on the selected variables.

## 2. Dataset

We will be visualizing a [dataset]( https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews/data) of 130,000 wine reviews. Each review has 12 variables that describes the wine being reviewed (description, rating, price, wine title, variety), the origin of the wine (country, province, vineyard designation, vineyard region, winery) and information about the reviewer (taster name, taster twitter handle).
