# Wine Review Proposal
## 1. Overview

When costumers filter products based on specified preferences on the website of a large liquor supply chain, they often receive pages and pages of product recommendations. This can cause costumer frustration and discourage them from continuing their search for products from the company. To address this challenge and help large liquor supply chains maintain their customer base, we propose building a data visualization app that can be deployed by liquor supply chains for their costumers to visually explore and navigate a large inventory. The app will show: 1) the count distributions of recommended wines based on the factors selected by the user, 2) a mapping of wine recommendations on an interactive world map, and 3) a summary with the average price, average rating, and wine counts for each country based on the selected variables.

## 2. Dataset

We will be visualizing a [dataset]( https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews/data) of 130,000 wine reviews. Each review has 12 variables that describe the wine being reviewed (description, rating, price, wine title, variety), the origin of the wine (country, province, vineyard designation, vineyard region, winery) and information about the reviewer (taster name, taster twitter handle).
