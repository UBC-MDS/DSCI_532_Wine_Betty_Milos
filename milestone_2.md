# Wine Review Milestone 2

Milos Milic and Betty Zhou

## 1. Rationale

Our Rationale for designing this app was to provide an easy to use interactive tool for a user (whether an institutional customer like owners of restaurants or bars or an individual customer) to find potential wines within their budget and rating criteria. We wanted to design three sections: The slider section on the left, The Bar Chart section with tabs on the upper right and the summary table on the bottom right. 


## 2. Tasks

We had Three Broad tasks for our Milestone 2:

##### Build correct sliders
  - We wanted to have correct sliders for the Rating and Price range to be implemented and update the dataset.

##### Have the correct table information shown
  - The original dataset had many superfluous columns that did not need to be shown to the user and needed to be removed. We just wanted to show: __Price, Rating, Country, Province, Variety, Title, Name of Rater, Description__.

  - As __Price__ and __Rating__ does filter results, We wanted to have more options for the user to filter out the subset of wines they collected. We added filter boxes above the table for the user to filter out. ![dashBoard](/img/price_distribution.PNG "price distribution")

##### Have the tabs implemented
  - We added two tabs for the upper right area of the app which allows the user to look at the Rating Distribution or Price Distribution Bar Charts

## 3 Vision  and Next Steps

Ultimately we wanted to have a rather intuitive user interface for filtering out the wines. We are toying with the idea of including a map That highlights the countries in the subset of data, but we are unsure if it would add to the functionality of the app. Hopefully some feedback will allow us on which ideas we can further implement. We are also thinking of including more buttons on the left such as: __Country__ and __Wine Variety__ to add to the functionality. Some formatting of the table legends should be implemented as some of the values appear too small when rendered on a high resolution screen.


## 4. Bugs

We have not come across any bug yet.
